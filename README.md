# MobileAPI
Server side PHP scripts enabling the mobile appliction communicate with database on remote server.
There are several scripts here which when called by the mobile app through Android Volley api, execute the required MySQL statements to get or store the relevant data in the database. 
Also included is the Java code of the mobile app which calls the scripts and then processes the results.
