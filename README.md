# MediScreen-Website
This is the website for the project which is intended for participating medical and insurance professionals. 
Professionals can view a list of their patients/clients, select any and view their details. If the pateient/client has
entered sufficient medical data via their mobile app, professionals can also get an estimate of their risk of developing
certain medical conditions through the Medi-AI service. Professionals may also create reports which are stored to the database.
Insurance professionals can view a medical professioanal's report for a particular patient, but an insurance professional's report
is not visisble to the patient's medical professional.
