# MediScreen-Website
This is the website for the project which is intended for participating medical and insurance professionals. 
Professionals, once registered and logged in can view a list of their patients/clients, select any and view their details. 
If a patient/client has entered sufficient medical data via their mobile app, professionals can also get an estimate of that patient's risk of developing certain medical conditions through the Medi-AI service. Professionals may also create reports which are stored to the database. Insurance professionals can view a medical professioanal's report for a particular patient, but an insurance professional's report is not visible to the patient's medical professional.
